To implement a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for images using PHP and AJAX, you will need to build a system that allows users to upload, display, update, and delete images without refreshing the page. Here's an overview of how this can be achieved:

Tech Stack:
PHP: For server-side logic and interaction with the database.
MySQL: To store the image details (file paths).
AJAX (JavaScript): To asynchronously communicate with the server, perform CRUD operations, and update the page dynamically.
HTML/BOOTSTRAP: For the front-end structure and design.
jQuery: To simplify AJAX requests and DOM manipulation
